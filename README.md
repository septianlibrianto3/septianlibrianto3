- 👋 Hi, I’m @septianlibrianto3
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and DevOps automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cost optimization with Kubecost and scaling GitHub Actions runners on Kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cloud-native projects, CI/CD pipelines, and FastAPI monitoring integrations.
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/septianlibrianto3) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/septian-librianto-355b6a241). 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I drive a classic BMW E36 and can talk about cars as much as I do about DevOps!
